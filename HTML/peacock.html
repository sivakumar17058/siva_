<p>The peacock, the national bird of India, is renowned for its vibrant, iridescent plumage, especially
 the male's long, fan-like tail feathers, which it displays during courtship. 
Here's a paragraph elaborating on the peacock
The peacock, a symbol of beauty and grace, is a bird of striking beauty, especially the males, known as 
peacocks, with their long, colorful tail feathers that they fan out to attract mates. These birds, also
 called peahens, are omnivorous, feeding on seeds, insects, fruits, and even small mammals. While they are
 capable of flight, they often prefer to walk or run on the ground, and are commonly found near human 
settlements, though they are shy birds. The peacock's distinctive features, including its iridescent blue
 head and neck, a white patch under the eye, and the fan-shaped crest of feathers, make it a truly captivating
 creature</p>
