<p>The solar system is a gravitationally bound system consisting of the Sun and all the celestial bodies that orbit it. This includes the eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other icy bodies. The Sun, a yellow dwarf star, is at the center of the solar system and contains 99.8% of its mass. 
Here's a more detailed look at the components of the solar system:
Key Components:

    The Sun: The central star, a yellow dwarf, that dominates the system with its gravity. 

Planets: There are eight planets in the solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
Dwarf Planets: These are celestial bodies that orbit the sun but do not have enough gravity to clear their orbital path of other objects. There are five officially recognized dwarf planets: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. 
Moons: Naturally orbiting bodies that are bound to planets, with many planets having multiple moons. 
Asteroids: Rock-like objects, mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. 
Comets: Icy bodies that release gas and dust as they approach the Sun. 
Other Icy Bodies: Small icy bodies in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, beyond Neptune. 

Formation and Structure:

    The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing region of a molecular cloud, according to NASA Science.

The inner solar system (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) is characterized by rocky, terrestrial planets. 
The outer solar system (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) is dominated by gas giant planets. 
The asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter, contains numerous rocky asteroids. 
The Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud are distant regions filled with icy bodies. 

The solar system is a dynamic and complex system, with ongoing scientific exploration revealing more about its composition and evolution.
